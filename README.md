## What is this about?

​		This is just a perfect practice project for anyone who is interested in using Django to develop web application. Meanwhile, get use to the Github way of collaboration in a opensource project.

## why Instagram?

​		Because Instagram is a famous website with tons of functionalities to work with. For example, log in and out, post files, register and so on. And of course, the biggest reason is that Instagram is actually powered by Django framework!! Fun fact uh~ :-)
